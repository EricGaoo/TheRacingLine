//:Welcome to your first corner! Let's start simple :)
//:
//:There are 3 factors to keep in mind when taking the line: entry, apex and exit. The entry is where you start the corner, the apex is the curb on the inside of the corner and the exit is where you leave the corner.
//:
//: The fundemental rules of the taking the driving line are:
//: 1. Start your entry on the opposite side of the apex
//: 2. When you turn in, hit the apex
//: 3. And finally, take your exit on the opposite side of the apex like the entry
//:
//: # Try it out!
//: Run the code and take a look at the different lines. Tap each button to see the lines and hold down the one that you think is the best! Make sure to keep the fundamental rules in mind and good luck!
