//: # Turn 3
//: Here's Turn 3, also known as a constant radius corner! This on is a bit more tricky so have some fun!
//:
//: In Large roundabout corners, racing drivers take a different approach:
//:
//: 1. Maintain the same entry
//: 2. Turn into the corner late
//: 3. Hit the apex right before you exit the corner
//:
//: Now, start trying to recognize where the apex is by yourself!
//:
//: Try it out!
//: Run the code and take a look at the different lines. Tap each button to see the lines and hold down the one that you think is the best! Make sure to keep the rules in mind and good luck!
