//: # Turn 4
//: Now check out Turn 4, also known as a Hairpin.
//:
//: Just like constant radius corners, Hairpins follow a similar line however, the driver can turn into the corner earlier!
//:
//: Remember:
//:
//: 1. Maintain the same entry
//: 2. Turn into the corner late
//: 3. Hit the apex right before you exit the corner
//:
//: # Try it out!
//: Run the code and take a look at the different lines. Tap each button to see the lines and hold down the one that you think is the best! Make sure to keep the rules in mind and good luck!
