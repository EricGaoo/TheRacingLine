//: # Turn 5
//: Turn 5! Last corner known as a double apex corner
//:
//: This corner lines up perfectly to allow the driver to take it as a single corner. The exit of the first apex functions as the entry of the next making it a single corner
//:
//:Remember everything you've learned and feel free to refer to previous corners with the navigator! Have fun!
//:
//: # Try it out!
//: Run the code and take a look at the different lines. Tap each button to see the lines and hold down the one that you think is the best! Make sure to keep the rules in mind and good luck!
